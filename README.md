**Mantis** is a foundation model trained entirely on mechanistic outbreak simulations.  
It forecasts infectious disease trajectories **without needing any real-world training data**, and generalizes across diseases, regions, and outbreak settings.

## 📦 Installation

To install the latest version directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/carsondudley1/Mantis.git
```

## 💾 Model Weights

Model weights are available on the [Releases page](https://github.com/carsondudley1/Mantis/releases).  
Each `.pt` file corresponds to a specific configuration (4-week / 8-week, with / without covariates).  

After installation, download your desired model like this:

```bash
mkdir -p models
wget -O models/mantis_4w_cov.pt https://github.com/carsondudley1/Mantis/releases/download/mantis-v1.0/mantis_4w_cov.pt
```

## 🧪 Quick Example

```
from mantis import Mantis

# Load a 4-week horizon model with covariates
model = Mantis(forecast_horizon=4, use_covariate=True)

# Predict on example data
forecast = model.predict(
    time_series=deaths_ts,         # e.g. past deaths
    covariate=hosp_ts,         # e.g. past hospitalizations
    target_type=2,                # 0 = cases, 1 = hosp, 2 = deaths
    covariate_type=1
)
```
